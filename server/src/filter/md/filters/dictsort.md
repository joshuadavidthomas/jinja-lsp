**dictsort**
   
Dict sorting functionality.

This filter works like `|items` but sorts the pairs by key first.
The filter accepts a few keyword arguments:
* `case_sensitive`: set to `true` to make the sorting of strings case sensitive.
* `by`: set to `"value"` to sort by value. Defaults to `"key"`.
* `reverse`: set to `true` to sort in reverse.
